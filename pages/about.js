          <h3>👋🤓 Hello there reader (and maybe future employer)</h3>
          <p>
            I just finished my 2 years as a front-end development student at
            noroff, and with this basic knowledge I want to start a career in
            web design! With no prior experience in the field I think the
            program has given me a lot of tools and understanding to build on.
